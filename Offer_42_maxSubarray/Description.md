# 剑指 Offer 42. 连续子数组的最大和 (Easy) Maximum sum of contiguous subarrays

You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of `n` elements.

Find a contiguous subarray that has the maximum sum value and return this value.

The time complexity should be O(n).

## Example:
```
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Output: the contiguous subarray is [4,-1,2,1], which has the maximum sum value.
```
